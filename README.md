# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Tic-tac-toe Python, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a very simple two-player game where both the player get to choose any of the symbols between X and O. This game is played on a 3X3 grid board and one by one each player gets a chance to mark its respective symbol on the empty spaces of the grid.
## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Player 1 is represented by 'X' and Player 2 by 'O'. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
   
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns to place their symbol on an empty cell of the grid.
   - The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
   - If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

3. **Game Controls**:
   - Player 1: Enter position number (1 through 9) to place 'X'.
   - Player 2: Enter position number (1 through 9) to place 'O'.

4. **Getting Started**: Run the Python script `python run.py` in the terminal.
